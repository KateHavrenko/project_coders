This is my aplication page for ***Founders and Coders** course.

I've made all prerequisites:
    ---
    * Complete FreeCodeCamp
    ---
    * Reach 5 kyu and got more than 300 points on Codewars
    ---
    * Create webpage there you can see links to these resourses and carousel
    ---

I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla Javasript**. Also I used **Unsplash API** to generate images to my gallery.
