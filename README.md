Project for founders and coders course
===


This is my aplication page for **Founders and Coders** course.

I've completed all prerequisites:

* Complete FreeCodeCamp

* Reach 5 kyu and got more than 300 points on Codewars.

* Create a webpage with a carousel and links to the pages above.

I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla Javasript**. Also I used **Unsplash API** to generate images to my gallery. 

I've tested my website on computer and smartphone but it works best in Chrome.
