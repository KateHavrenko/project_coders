                <p class="info">I'm from Ukraine, but I have been living in London Since June 2018.
                    I had a little experience in web developments. I worked at small company in Ukraine and made simple websites 
                    using Wordpress.  I have been working in charity shop in London near Archway station during this year.
                    When I found your website I was very excited to know about oportunities what you gave to your students.
                    I want to be a part of your team because I think it's great possibility to become a programmer and for
                     me to improve my Javascript skills.

                            <p>I really like cycling. Every weekend I rent a bicycle
                                 and have a ride in London parks. As there was no opportunity
                                  in my childhood. Cycling is something I learned in my 20s.
