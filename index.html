                    <p>A Ukrainian girl living in London since June 2018.</p>
                    <p>I have gained some coding knowledge at the lyceum and then at the university where I received my civil engineering degree.
                    <p>In Ukraine, I worked at a small company and made simple websites using Wordpress. During the last half a year, coding appeared as a fulfilling and a promising way of building my career.</p>
                    <p>After moving to London, I realized this topic was still more than relevant.</p>
                    <p>I have worked in a charity shop in London near Archway station since August. It was a resourceful, challenging, cheering, and productive experience. Besides giving my time to a charity shop, I was constantly updating myself with new information. Once I found F&C program, I was dedicating even more time to accomplishing the course prerequisites as they could improve and develop my skills in this field.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your help to gain new profession and change lives. This is the value I find very uplifting as well as your assistance to enroll in the course. I want to be a part of your team because it's a great opportunity to become a programmer for me.</p>

                            <p>I really like cycling. Every weekend I rent a bicycle
                                 and have a ride in London parks. As there was no opportunity
                                  in my childhood. Cycling is something I learned in my 20s.
